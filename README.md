# Market Basket Analysis with Association Rules

This project performs **market basket analysis** on the `BreadBasket_DMS.csv` 
dataset to discover **association rules** (e.g., “If a customer buys Coffee, they also buy Bread”) 
and generate a **recommender system**.

The output of the model is saved as a CSV file: `association_rules_OUTPUT.csv`

# Dataset Overview
- **Key Columns:**
  - `Date`: Date of purchase
  - `Time`: Time of purchase
  - `Transaction`: Transaction ID
  - `Item`: Item purchased

# Files Included:
